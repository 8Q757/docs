description: "Explore community-built APIs for accessing NEAR Protocol on-chain data, including NearBlocks, FastNear, The Graph, PIKESPEAK, and other indexing solutions."
---

Members of the NEAR community have built a set of APIs to access and monitor on-chain data. These APIs are designed to be easy to use and can be accessed from any application through a simple API call.

- [NearBlocks API](../tools/ecosystem-apis/nearblocks-api.md): Query actions that happened on a NEAR account
- [FastNear API](../tools/ecosystem-apis/fastnear-api.md): Exposes low-latency APIs for wallets and explorers
- [PIKESPEAK API](../tools/ecosystem-apis/pikespeak-api.md): an enterprise-grade API where you can fetch blockchain events and aggregated analytics on wallets, validators, delegators, money transfers, dapps activity and more

- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/near/): The Graph gives developers tools to process blockchain events and make the resulting data easily available via a GraphQL API, known individually as a subgraph. [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) is now able to process NEAR events, which means that NEAR developers can now build subgraphs to index their smart contracts.
- [SubQuery](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/near.html): A fast, flexible, and reliable open-source data indexer that provides you with custom APIs for your web3 project across NEAR and many other chains
